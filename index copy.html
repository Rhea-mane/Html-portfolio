<h1>The Best Movies According to Rhea</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Watching "Avatar," I felt sort of the same as when I saw "Star Wars" in 1977. </p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Like a great iron Sphinx on the ocean floor, the Titanic faces still toward the West, interrupted forever on its only voyage.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>For all the pre-release speculation about how analog epic-maker Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer" would re-create the explosion of the first atomic bomb, the film's most spectacular attraction turns out to be something else: the human face.
